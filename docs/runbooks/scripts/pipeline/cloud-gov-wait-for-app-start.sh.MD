### Runbook for `cloud-gov-wait-for-app-start.sh`

#### Introduction
The script `cloud-gov-wait-for-app-start.sh` is a Bash script designed to monitor the health and status of an application running on the Cloud.gov platform until it reaches a "running" state. It is particularly useful in automation and orchestration workflows where ensuring an application is fully operational before proceeding with further actions is essential.

#### Technical Breakdown

##### Technical Analysis of the Code
The script performs the following actions:
- Initializes the variable `app_name` to accept a single argument from the user input, which is expected to be the name of the Cloud.gov application that needs to be monitored.
- The `while : ; do` statement is set to loop indefinitely until the script satisfies a break condition.
- Inside the loop, the script invokes the Cloud.gov `cf app` command, which retrieves information about the application. The output is then piped through `grep` to filter the line containing `#0` (which typically references the primary instance of the application) and `awk` to isolate the second field, which corresponds to the status of the application instance.
- An `if` statement checks if the isolated status is `"running"`. If true, the loop breaks, indicating that the application has started successfully. If the status does not indicate `"running"`, the script prints a message to the console and waits 2 seconds before retrying the status check.

#### Troubleshooting
- **Application Status Update**: If the script does not detect an update in the application's status, first validate that the application name passed as an argument is correct and matches the format of the Cloud.gov application names. Confirm via the `cf app {app_name}` command whether the application does indeed appear with a `running` status or if it remains in another state like `"starting"` or `"down"`.
- **Network Issues**: If the `cf app` command isnâ€™t returning expected output or times out, it indicates possible network issues with Cloud.gov. Run the command manually and check further with `curl <Cloud.gov-url>` to ensure connectivity.
- **Script Syntax**: Errors in running the script can be due to syntax issues, missing variables, or incorrect use of command-line arguments. Ensure the script has been saved with proper execution permissions (`chmod +x`) and run `bash -x ./cloud-gov-wait-for-app-start.sh` for detailed debugging logs.
