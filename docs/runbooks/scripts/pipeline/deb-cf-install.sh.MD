### Runbook for `deb-cf-install.sh`

#### Introduction

This runbook is for the Bash script `deb-cf-install.sh`, which automates the process of installing the CloudFoundry (CF) package and its associated plugin. The script initially points to the correct release version of CloudFoundry and installs it by moving the executable to `/usr/local/bin` for system-wide use. It also installs an additional CF plugin for enhanced service management.

#### Technical Breakdown

**Step 1: Define the CloudFoundry Package URL**

The script sets the correct URL for the CloudFoundry package to be installed.

**Step 2: Installation Process**

The script outputs a message indicating the installation process has begun and utilizes a set of commands in a block:
```bash
echo "Installing CloudFoundry repository..."
{
  curl -L "${cf_package}" | tar -zx
  if [ "$(whoami)" != "root" ]; then
    sudo mv cf cf8 /usr/local/bin
  else
    mv cf cf8 /usr/local/bin
  fi
  cf install-plugin -f https://github.com/cloud-gov/cf-service-connect/releases/download/v1.1.4/cf-service-connect_linux_amd64
} >/dev/null 2>&1
```
1. The `curl` command fetches the CloudFoundry package.
2. The `tar -zx` command extracts the downloaded package.
3. The following conditional checks if the current user is the root user. If not, it escalates the process to root using `sudo` and installs the `cf` and `cf8` commands in `/usr/local/bin`. Otherwise, it directly moves the files for installation.
4. The `cf install-plugin` command installs the `cf-service-connect` plugin for CloudFoundry.  This plugin is used for creating a tunnel to a CloudFoundry service.

**Step 3: Error Handling and Output Redirection**

The script runs the installation process in a block, piping both stdout and stderr to `/dev/null`. This ensures that any output, whether successful or erroneous, is not shown to the user.

#### Troubleshooting

1. **Error: Missing root privileges.**
   - **Solution:** Ensure the script is run with `sudo` privileges if the current user is not the root user or a user with `sudo` privileges.
  
2. **Error: Unable to download CloudFoundry package.**
   - **Solution:** Verify network connectivity and ensure that the URL specified (`cf_package`) is correct and accessible.
   - If the package server is down, check the official package list for any changes.

3. **Error: Installation of the plugin fails.**
   - **Solution:** Verify the URL of the plugin and ensure compatibility with the installed version of CloudFoundry.
   - Check if there are newer versions of the plugin available on the release page and update the URL accordingly.

4. **Error: Executable path is incorrect.**
   - **Solution:** The installation moves `cf` and `cf8` to `/usr/local/bin`. Verify that this directory is included in the `PATH` environment variable.
   - Check to ensure the files were correctly placed in `/usr/local/bin`:
   ```bash
   ls -l /usr/local/bin/cf
   ls -l /usr/local/bin/cf8
   ```

5. **Error: Plugin binary is missing.**
   - **Solution:** Manually download the plugin binary and verify its checksum before attempting installation again.

6. **General Debugging Steps:**
   - Run the script without redirecting the output to `/dev/null`. This can be done simply by removing the `>/dev/null 2>&1` part of the script, which might reveal the root cause of the failure.
