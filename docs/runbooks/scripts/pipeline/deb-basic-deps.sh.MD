### Runbook for `deb-basic-deps.sh`

#### Introduction

The script `deb-basic-deps.sh`, is a bash script designed to install essential system dependencies on a Debian-based Linux system. It checks the current user and executes commands accordingly to ensure the script can work effectively in both root and non-root environments.

#### Technical Breakdown

The script's primary function is to install `curl` and `gettext` (for the `envsubst` command) on a Debian-based system, either with or without root privileges. This is achieved through conditional execution based on whether the current user has root privileges.

- If the user is not the root user (`whoami != root`), the script resorts to `sudo` to run the required apt commands, thereby requiring the user to provide their password if necessary.
- If the user is root, `apt` commands are executed directly without the need for `sudo`.

The `/dev/null 2>&1` redirection at the end of the block silences standard output and standard error, ensuring the script runs quietly in the background without cluttering the terminal with output.

#### Code Execution

1. **Dependency Installation**:
    - The script updates the system repositories with `apt-get update`.
    - Then installs `curl` and `gettext` using `apt-get install -y`.

2. **Conditional Execution for Privilege Management**:
    - The user runs the script (`deb-basic-deps.sh`).
    - Upon being executed, the script determines the user running it. 
    - If the user is not `root`, it leverages `sudo` to perform administrative tasks.
    - If the user is `root`, the script performs administrative tasks directly.

3. **Error Suppression**:
    - The script sends the standard output and error messages to `/dev/null`, ensuring the output is not visible to the user. This technique is used for minimalistic interaction scenarios, focusing on quiet operation.

### Troubleshooting

1. **Insufficient Permissions**:
    - If the user is attempting to execute the script without appropriate permissions, an error may occur. To resolve this, ensure the user has the necessary `sudo` privileges or run the script as `root`.
  
2. **Network Issues**:
    - Dependency installation errors can arise from network connectivity problems. Ensure the system has internet access while updating the repositories and installing dependencies.
  
3. **Repository Issues**:
    - If updating the repository returns errors or does not find the specified packages (`curl` and `gettext`), it might be due to a malformed `sources.list` file or official repositories being inaccessible. Update the `sources.list` to the correct state or mirror that provides the required packages.
  
4. **Missing `sudo` Configuration**:
    - If the user does not have `sudo` availability, install `sudo` first or elevate the user account as a member of the `sudoers` group to allow elevated actions.

5. **Script Execution Errors**:
    - Syntax or execution errors can occur if the script encounters problems during execution. Ensure that the script is executable (`chmod +x deb-basic-deps.sh`), and verify the integrity and syntax correctness of the script.
