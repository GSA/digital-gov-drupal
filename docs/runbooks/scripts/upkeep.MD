### Runbook for `upkeep`

#### Overview

The script `upkeep` automated a series of tasks related to static site generation, find and replace URL operations, file copying, and upload of resources to Amazon S3. The script has multiple conditional and sequential steps that ensure the tasks are performed appropriately in various environments.

#### Technical Breakdown

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initializes the `home` and `app_path` variables.
   - Sets up the environment for the static site at `${app_path}/html`.
   - Retrieves critical environment variables (like `application_uri`, AWS credentials, bucket information) from the JSON content of `${VCAP_APPLICATION}` and `${VCAP_SERVICES}`.

2. **Environment Readiness:**
   - Changes directory to `${app_path}`.
   - Clears and regenerates the XML sitemap for the static site.
   - Runs Drupal cron to ensure all necessary background processes are completed.
   - Commits the static site generation by executing `drush tome:static`. This process uses the specified URI "${STATIC_URI}" and includes retry mechanisms.
   - Enforces the XML sitemap URL value.

3. **URL Mapping and Replacements:**
   - Searches through the generated site files located at `${html_path}` and performs necessary find and replace operations to ensure URL consistency.
   - Specifically replaces absolute URLs with relative ones, streamlining internal links and S3-based file URLs.

4. **Additional File Handling:**
   - Copies core assets and Digital.gov custom theme assets into their respective directories within the static site folder.
   - Copies `robots.txt` file based on the environment, ensuring that the site is properly indexed by search engines.

5. **Post-Processing Actions:**
   - Cleans up by deleting unnecessary redirect files and empty directories to maintain a tidy and efficient structure.
   - Syncs the static site files with an S3 bucket to ensure they are live and ready for public access.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Error Handling:**
  - Any error during the execution of the script will cause it to halt due to `set -e`. 
  - Check the script logs or output for the exact error message, which can provide insight into the issue ranging from file not found errors to script syntax errors.

- **Debugging Tips:**
  - Enable debugging output by uncommenting or adding `set -x` to see a detailed trace of executed commands, which can help pinpoint where a step might be failing.
  - Ensure environment variables ({`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `STATIC_URI`, etc}) are correctly set and accessible within the script's execution context.

- **Access and Authentication Issues:**
  - Verify if AWS credentials are up-to-date and have the necessary permissions to access and write to the S3 bucket.
  - Check that the S3 endpoint or bucket names are correctly referenced in the script.

- **File Not Found Errors:**
  - Confirm the source path (referenced, for example, in the robots.txt handling section) is correct and the files exist.
  - Alternatively, the script should handle this gracefully by printing a warning and skipping the operation.

The documentation shows a comprehensive set of tasks, but troubleshooting issues may sometimes require specific domain knowledge about Drupal, Amazon S3, and shell scripting that may not be outright covered in this runbook.  Check application documentation for additional troubleshooting solutions.
