### Runbook for `validate.yml`

#### Introduction

This runbook provides an overview and detailed guidance on the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `validation.yml`. The workflow is designed to run validation jobs on new and updated code when a pull request or a push event occurs on branches within the `feature/**` directory. 

#### Technical Breakdown

##### Workflow Overview

The `validation.yml` workflow file specifies a sequence of activities that are triggered on pull requests and pushes to feature branches:

1. **Trigger Events**
   - **Pull Request**: The workflow is set to run on pull request events.
   - **Push**: It also triggers on push events but only for branches within the `feature/**` directory.

2. **Jobs Execution**
   - The `validate` job is defined to run `.github/workflows/validation-run.yml`, ensuring consistent validation logic throughout the repository.
   - Workflow secrets are inherited by the job, allowing secure access to necessary configurations without hardcoding them into the workflow.
   
##### Technical Analysis

The specified workflow leverages the `.github/workflows` structure to modularize the run logic for `validate` jobs, which means the validation process can be easily expanded or modified in a centralized YAML file (`validation-run.yml`). This modularization also promotes code reuse and easier maintenance.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Issue:** Pull requests are not triggering the workflow.
  - **Solution:** Ensure that the branch names adhere to the pattern `feature/**`. Additionally, check if the file name `validation.yml` is correctly referenced and the YAML file is correctly placed within the `.github/workflows/` directory.

- **Issue:** Workflow fails due to missing or incorrect secret variables.
  - **Solution:** Check the repository's secrets settings to confirm that all required secrets are properly defined and that the `inherit` keyword is appropriately used in the workflow. If the secrets are sensitive, be sure to note that the repository must respect Bixal policy on handling sensitive information.

- **Issue:** Validation logic does not seem to align with expected behavior.
  - **Solution:** Review the `validation-run.yml` file to ensure that the expected validation steps are correctly implemented. Any discrepancies in expected vs. actual behavior should be resolved by adjusting the logic within `validation-run.yml`.
