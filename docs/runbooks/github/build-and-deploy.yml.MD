### Runbook for `build-and-deploy.yml`

#### Introduction
This runbook provides a detailed guide for understanding, executing, and maintaining the GitHub Actions workflow defined in the `build-and-deploy.yml` file. The workflow is designed to handle branch-based code validation and deployment operations. It's configured to work with specific branches such as `develop`, `main`, `stage`, and custom feature branches prefixed with `feature/DIGITAL-*`.

#### Technical Breakdown

**Workflow Structure and Purpose**
The workflow is broken into three main jobs (`validate`, `deploy-infra`, and `deploy-app`). These jobs validate code, deploy infrastructure using Terraform, and deploy the application to the target environment, respectively.

**Branch Rules**
This workflow is triggered by pushes to specific branches:
- `develop`
- `main`
- `stage`
- `feature/DIGITAL-*-deploydev`
- `feature/DIGITAL-*-deploystaging`
- `release/*`
- `hotfix/*`

This ensures that the workflow only runs on branches that require validation and deployment actions.

**Job Dependencies**
Each of the jobs (`validate`, `deploy-infra`, `deploy-app`) has implicit dependencies:
- `deploy-infra` must wait for `validate` to succeed.
- `deploy-app` must wait for `deploy-infra` to succeed.

**Permissions**
The workflow operates with in-house permissions for `contents` set to `read` and `packages` set to `write`. These configurations are critical for ensuring that the workflow can read from the repository's contents and publish packages, if necessary.

**Job Definitions**
- **validate**: This job calls another workflow located at `.github/workflows/validation-run.yml`, inheriting secrets from the parent workflow.
- **deploy-infra**: This job is responsible for deploying the infrastructure. It also calls another workflow at `.github/workflows/terraform-deploy-infra.yml`, requiring validation to have been completed.
- **deploy-app**: This job takes care of deploying the application to the target environment using a workflow at `.github/workflows/cloudgov-deploy-app.yml`.

**Deployment and Infrastructure Integration**
The sequence of events in the jobs showcases an efficient flow from validation through to application deployment. The seamless integration of Terraform for infrastructure deployment and subsequent application deployment is notable.

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues and Syntax Fixes**
- **Branch Validation Errors**: If the workflow fails to execute even when pushed to a valid branch, check if the branch name matches exactly.
- **Permission Errors**: If the workflow fails to read repository contents or write to packages, confirm the role permissions are set correctly.
- **Job Execution Errors**: Use the `needs` feature effectively to verify dependencies are met. 
- **Infrastructure Deployment Failures**: These often relate to Terraform configurations or network issues. Refer to `.github/workflows/terraform-deploy-infra.yml` for more details.
- **Application Deployment Failures**: Review `.github/workflows/cloudgov-deploy-app.yml` and ensure environment variables are properly set.

**Debugging Information**
For resolving issues, check the GitHub Actions logs and associated documentation for each job's respective workflow. Providing explicit troubleshooting steps for integration with external tools like Terraform usually involves confirming directory paths, using `terraform init`, and ensuring that all Terraform dependencies are up-to-date.
