### Runbook for `cloudgov-deploy-app.yml`

#### Introduction
 The script `cloudgov-deploy-app.yml` is a GitHub Actions workflow script designed to automate the deployment process of a web application to Cloud.gov across different environments, such as development, staging, and production. The workflow script primarily defines the steps to update an application, including setting environment variables, building application components, and deploying the application to the specified Cloud.gov space.

#### Technical Breakdown

##### Overview of Workflow Structure
The workflow calls an external workflow, handling various tasks through a series of steps under the `updateApp` job. Each step performs a specific function, from checking out code to setting environment variables, and handles issues like branching logic to set the correct Cloud Foundry space for deployment.

###### Environment Setup
The workflow calls are contingent upon the current branch or tag name to set the appropriate Cloud Foundry environment variables like `CF_SPACE`, `DRUPAL_MEMORY`, and `DRUPAL_INSTANCES`. It handles specific branches differently, setting the `COMPOSER_DEV` flag accordingly to dictate whether the application is built with development dependencies.

###### Deployment Steps
- **Checkout**: The source code is checked out using the GitHub Actions checkout action.
- **Environment Setup**: An array of environment variables is defined and passed on to the GitHub environment using the `tee` command to append variables to `$GITHUB_ENV`. This includes keys and secrets required for the build and deploy process, such as `HASH_SALT`, `NEWRELIC_KEY`, and others.
- **Build Theme**: The workflow prepares the build for the theme by executing a shell script.
- **Deploy App**: The main part of the workflow entails deploying the application to the defined environment. It performs some prep work, like clearing the buildpack cache, before running the actual deploy script.

##### Troubleshooting

###### Step-Specific Errors

1. **Checkout Step**:
   - **Issue**: When attempting to check out the repository code, errors could be due to network timeouts, incorrect repository paths, or lack of permissions.
   - **Solution**: Verify that the GitHub Actions checkout action is properly configured and that the repository is accessible.

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - **Issue**: During assignment of environment variables, syntax errors or mismatches in branches may cause setup issues.
   - **Solution**: Double-check the `case` statements and ensure they cover all branches or add a default case for unrecognized branches.

3. **Build Theme**:
   - **Issue**: Build failures can arise from missing dependencies or faulty scripts.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that `deb-basic-deps.sh` and related scripts correctly install all required dependencies.
   
4. **Deploy App**:
   - **Issue**: Errors can occur due to an unresponsive Cloud.gov instance or incorrect credentials.
   - **Solution**: Verify the correctness of `COMPOSER_DEV`, `GSA_AUTH_KEY`, and all other environment variables. Make sure the `cf` command has the correct permissions to target and deploy to the specified space.

###### General Tips for Troubleshooting

- **Logging and Debugging**:
  - Use `echo` and `print` statements to trace variable values and execution paths.
  - Check the GitHub Actions log for more detailed error messages and stack traces.
  
- **Secrets Management**:
  - Ensure that secrets are correctly managed and not hard-coded in the script. This prevents information leak and maintains security.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: 
  - If issues persist, consider inspecting the entire CI/CD pipeline outside of this script. Ensure that other GitHub Actions workflows and repository settings align correctly with the intended deployment strategy.
