### Runbook for `generate-static-run-dev.yml`

### Introduction
This runbook is for a GitHub Actions workflow defined in `generate-static-run-dev.yml`. This workflow is configured to be triggered either by a workflow call with required secrets or by a schedule-based event. The workflow is designed to generate static content in the `dev` environment and requires certain secrets for authentication and project details. 

### Technical Breakdown

#### Workflow Triggers and Permissions
This workflow can be triggered in two ways:
1. **Workflow Call:** This is an event-driven trigger where the workflow can be invoked with required secrets.
2. **Schedule:** This workflow can also be triggered by a cron job that runs every 15 minutes of every hour.

The workflow has specific `permissions` set, allowing it to read repository contents and write packages.

#### Jobs Configuration
The workflow defines a single job named `generate-static`. The job `generate-static` uses a secondary workflow file, `generate-static.yml`, which is located in the `.github/workflows` directory. 

##### Job Input Configuration
The job is configured with the `CF_SPACE` parameter set to `dev`. Additionally, the job inherits all secrets from the workflow call.

#### Required Secrets
The workflow requires several secrets:
- `CF_USER`: Username for Cloud Foundry authentication.
- `CF_PASSWORD`: Password for Cloud Foundry authentication.
- `CF_ORG`: Organization in Cloud Foundry.
- `PROJECT`: Name of the project.
- `DATABASE_BACKUP_BASTION_NAME`: Name of the database backup bastion.

### Troubleshooting

#### Error in Triggering
If the workflow is not triggered despite the presence of secrets and the cron schedule has passed, it could be due to the following reasons:
- **Incorrect cron syntax**: Verify that the cron syntax is correct. For this workflow, the cron schedule `"15 * * * *"` should run every 15 minutes of every hour, and any internal GitHub issue or misconfiguration could prevent this.
- **Secrets Missing in Repository**: Ensure that all necessary secrets (`CF_USER`, `CF_PASSWORD`, `CF_ORG`, `PROJECT`, `DATABASE_BACKUP_BASTION_NAME`) are present and correctly configured in the repository settings.

#### Job Execution Failures
- **Job Fails Due to Missing Secrets**: Ensure that all required secrets are defined and available. The workflow fails to execute if any of the required secrets are missing.
- **Authentication Issues in Jobs**: If the credential secrets (`CF_USER`, `CF_PASSWORD`, `CF_ORG`) are incorrect, the workflow will fail to authenticate. Verify the input correctness of the secrets and the Cloud Foundry space configuration.

#### Debugging Jobs
- **Check Log Outputs**: Review the detailed logs provided by GitHub Actions within the workflow runs to identify exact failure points or error messages.
- **Manual Verification**: Manually verify the result of the `generate-static.yml` workflow in a local environment if possible, using the required parameters and secrets.
