### Runbook for `validation-run.yml`

#### Introduction
This runbook is for a GitHub Actions workflow for the script `validation-run.yml`. This workflow is designed to perform validation tasks on branch pushes and pull requests, ensuring that code changes adhere to certain quality standards.

#### Technical Breakdown

##### Overview of the Workflow
The workflow is structured into several key jobs and steps. It begins with a routine checkout of the code, followed by a series of steps to set up PHP, extract the branch name, configure Composer dependencies, and run validation checks.

##### Job Details
- **Checkout Code**: The code is checked out using the `actions/checkout@v4` action.
- **Extract Branch Name**: The branch name is extracted and stored in a variable for further use.
- **Setup PHP**: PHP version 8.3 is set up, and Composer v2 is included. Coverage is disabled to avoid unnecessary data gathering.
- **Composer Cache**: A caching step is implemented to optimize the performance of Composer package installations.
- **Install Composer Dependencies**: Dependencies are installed using Composer, with initialization for Robo as a fallback if `RoboFile.php` does not exist.
- **Branch Validation**: For branch pushes (`github.event_name == 'push'`), the workflow validates all changes non-specifically with the command `vendor/bin/robo validate:all non_pr`.
- **Pull Request Validation**: If triggered by a pull request (`github.event_name == 'pull_request'`), the workflow validates changes against both the target and current branches using the command `vendor/bin/robo validate:all only_pr`.

##### Underlying Principles
The workflow is designed to maintain consistent quality controls by automatically validating code changes in both branch pushes and pull requests. The principle behind this is to catch and correct issues early in the development process, reducing the burden on code reviewers and minimizing issues that could arise from faulty code merges.

#### Troubleshooting

##### Common Issues
- **Composer Installation Errors**: If the Composer dependencies fail to install, check network access to Composer repositories and ensure the correct version of PHP is specified.
- **Validation Failures**: If the validation fails, examine the specific error messages generated by the `robo validate` commands. Ensure that all required validation configurations are correctly set and up to date.
- **Branch Mismatch**: If validation errors occur due to branch mismatches, verify that branch names are correctly extracted and utilized in the validation commands.

##### Steps to Resolve
- **Update Dependencies**: Ensure that the `composer.lock` file has been updated and is consistent with your local changes.
- **Manual Robo Init**: If Robo initialization fails, manually run `vendor/bin/robo init` to generate a `RoboFile.php`.
- **Environment Variables**: Verify that environment variables used in the validation steps (e.g., branch names) are correctly sourced and provided.
