We invite guest speakers, share case studies, explore new tools, and provide support for new and current members trying to grow their A/B testing practice and knowledge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>## Who we are</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The A&amp;#47;B Testing Community of Practice started with a team at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), circa 2016. We were inspired by what weâ€™d learned from our own tests that, and see what we could learn from case studies outside CFPB. We are driven to foster a group that can share their experiences and learn from one another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>**Community Managers:**</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- [Kelley Holden](<u>mailto:kelley.holden@cfpb.gov</u>), works at the CFPB as a Digital Analytics Program Manager on the Data Science and Analytics team.
