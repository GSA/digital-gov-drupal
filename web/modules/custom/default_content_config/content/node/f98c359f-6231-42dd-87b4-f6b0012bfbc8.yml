      value: '<h2>What we do</h2><p>The A/B Testing Community of Practice organizes meetings to discuss the latest in A/B testing. We invite guest speakers, share case studies, explore new tools, and provide support for new and current members trying to grow their A/B testing practice and knowledge.</p><h2>Who we are</h2><p>The A/B Testing Community of Practice started with a team at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), circa 2016. We were inspired by what weâ€™d learned from our own tests that, and see what we could learn from case studies outside CFPB. We are driven to foster a group that can share their experiences and learn from one another.</p><p><strong>Community Managers:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="mailto:kelley.holden@cfpb.gov">Kelley Holden</a>, works at the CFPB as a Digital Analytics Program Manager on the Data Science and Analytics team.
