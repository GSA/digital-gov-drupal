## Software requirements

* PHP 8.3: Used to run `./robo.sh` / `./composer.sh` tasks
* Composer Version 2: https://getcomposer.org/, much faster to run composer locally than through docker
* Lando: https://lando.dev/download/

See our [Install Help documentation](docs/install-help.md) for a guide to installing the PHP and Composer
requirements locally.

## QuickStart installation

The local environment is configured to use
the [Lando Drupal Plugin](https://docs.lando.dev/plugins/drupal/getting-started.html). However, you cannot
just `lando start` the first time you start the site.

Once you have confirmed that you have PHP 8.3 and Composer 2 installed locally run the following CLI commands to get your
site running locally.

```
composer install
./robo.sh lando:init
# Installing a Drupal site from config (no DB needed).
lando si
```

Following that, you can interact with the environment like a normal Lando site using standard `lando` commands.

## Working with the codebase

There is some custom functionality apart from what's in the base Lando installation.

* See a list of shortcuts (Drush, Composer, etc.): `./robo.sh common:shortcuts-help`
* When switching to a new branch, always: `lando rebuild -y && lando si` to start off completely fresh.
* Export content as configuration `./robo.sh drupal-project:export-content`.
  See [Exporting Content as Configuration](docs/backend#exporting-content-as-configuration).

## Compiling theme assets

See our [Frontend documentation](docs/frontend.md) for working with the `digital_gov` custom theme.

## Basic command reference

### Composer commands
Instead of using `lando composer` we use `./composer.sh` which generate entries in `composer.log` so we can replay composer commands on conflicts.
